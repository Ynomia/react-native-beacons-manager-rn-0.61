# React Native Beacons Manager (w/ RN 0.61+ Support)

This is a fork of the [`react-native-beacons-manger`](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-native-beacons-manager) package. While development to make this compatible with React Native 0.61 (auto-linking) has commenced, it us not under active development and has not been publish to NPM.

This also makes some slight modifications to the Android configuration to resolve package conflicts with Android X.
